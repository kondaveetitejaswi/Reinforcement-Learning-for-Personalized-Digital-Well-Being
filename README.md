# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Personalized-Digital-Well-Being
This project aims to develop an AI-driven digital well-being system that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to promote healthier social media usage and improve mental well-being. By analyzing user habits, preferences, and digital behaviours, the system assigns a Mental Health Score (MHS) and dynamically suggests personalized interventions to reduce excessive screen time, encourage offline activities, and foster healthier digital habits.

The RL agent learns from user feedback, optimizing recommendations such as taking breaks, engaging in hobbies, reading, or limiting social media exposure. The project also incorporates gamification elements, including streaks, rewards, and progress tracking, to motivate users toward sustained behaviour change.
