Adding new profiles with age specific content for respective age groups (like teenage acount, children account etc) because cutting teenagers and children completely from social media seems impossible. So maybe filtering their content according to their age would help alot. Adding more motivational and educational content to their feed in an with entertainment will help them too.(These reforms should be done by government on social medias because this method will cuts down addiction and no company would take a reform which will tone down there profit).
More efficient report options (which can include things like advertisement of wrong behaviour of people or children) give more options and check thoroughly and take action without delay.
